            <h1>Tacna Chamber of Commerce</h1>
            <h2>Site plan</h2>

        <div>
            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p>The name of the site is simple and self-explanatory <span class="domine">"Tacna Chamber of Commerce"</span> was chosen to clearly represent the locale of Tacna and emphasize the organization's role as a chamber of commerce. This straightforward and location-specific name helps create a sense of identity and connection to the local business community.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The Tacna Chamber of Commerce is dedicated to serving as a pivotal hub for trade and business development in the Tacna region. We provide essential services to our members, fostering economic growth, and facilitating trade relationships within and beyond our community.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>What events will the Tacna Chamber of Commerce be hosting this month to promote business networking? <br> How can I get in touch with the leaders or board members of the Tacna Chamber of Commerce? <br> Can I find information about the business climate and opportunities in Tacna on the chamber's website? </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Color schema</h2>
            <p> <div class="box color1"></div> The primary color of the website is this shade of blue. I selected blue to evoke a sense of trust and security</p>
            <p> <div class="box color2"></div> White, on the other hand, is chosen to symbolize transparency and honesty.</p>
            <p>By incorporating this color scheme, the Tacna Chamber of Commerce website will present a professional and visually appealing design, with blue providing a sense of trust and reliability, and white ensuring a clean and easy-to-read layout..<br><br>I'll add grey or dark blue.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>For titles and the menu, I've decided to utilize the Domine font. <span class="domine">This serif font conveys a sense of stability and seriousness, which aligns well with the confidence-focused nature of this business.</span></p>
            <p>As for the main body of the page, including all the text, I've opted for the Open Sans font. It's a sans-serif font known for its readability and straightforward design.</p>
            <p>If there's a need to emphasize or present something differently, <span class="seaweed">I'll employ the Seaweed Script font.</span></p>
